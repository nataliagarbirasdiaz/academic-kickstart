I am a [Max Weber Fellow](https://www.eui.eu/people?id=natalia-garbiras-diaz) at the European University Institute. I received my PhD in Political Science from the University of California, Berkeley, where I am currently a Research Associate at the [Center on the Politics of Development](https://cpd.berkeley.edu/people/research-associates/).

My main research interests are in comparative politics and the political economy of development, focusing on corruption, public goods provision, and accountability in Latin America. I also study the formation of citizen and ex-combatant attitudes and their role in stabilizing peace in post-conflict settings. In my dissertation, I explored the information and institutional environments that pave the way for outsider candidates' rise and success.

I hold an M.A. in Economics from the University of Los Andes (Colombia). Before coming to Berkeley, I worked at the World Bank, the Observatory of Democracy, and Colombia's National Planning Department.
