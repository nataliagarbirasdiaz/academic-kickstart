I am an Assistant Professor in the Business, Government and the International Economy (BGIE) unit at Harvard Business School. Prior to joining HBS, I was a [Max Weber Fellow](https://www.eui.eu/people?id=natalia-garbiras-diaz) at the European University Institute. I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of California, Berkeley, where I am currently a Research Associate at the [Center on the Politics of Development](https://cpd.berkeley.edu/people/research-associates/). 

My main research interests are in comparative politics and the political economy of development, with a focus on corruption, public goods provision, and accountability in Latin America. I also study the formation of citizen and ex-combatant attitudes and their role in stabilizing peace in post-conflict settings. In my dissertation, I examined the informational and institutional environments that pave the way for the rise and success of outsider candidates.

I hold an M.A. in Economics from the University of Los Andes (Colombia). Prior to my Ph.D., I worked at the World Bank, the Democracy Observatory, and the Colombian National Planning Department.
