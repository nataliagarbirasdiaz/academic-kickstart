I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley, and a Research Associate at the Center on the Politics of Development.

My main research interests are in comparative politics and the political economy of development, with a particular focus on corruption, public goods provision and new parties in Latin America. I also study the formation of citizen attitudes towards peace agreements. In my dissertation, I study the supply and demand for outsider candidates in Latin America.

I hold an M.A. in Economics from the University of Los Andes (Colombia). Prior to coming to Berkeley, I worked at the World Bank as Junior Professional Associate. I also worked at the Observatory of Democracy, a research center in charge of conducting LAPOP surveys in Colombia, and at the National Planning Department, a government agency in Colombia.
