<h3>Political Accountability and Development</h3> <p>

<summary> <strong strong style="color:royalblue"> Electoral Integrity and Local Development </strong>  <br/>
Natalia Garbiras-Díaz and Mateo Montenegro <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
Does electoral integrity improve local development? Prevailing theories of democracy suggest that well-functioning elections allow citizens to select good politicians (<i>selection channel</i>) and incentivize their effort (<i>accountability channel</i>). Despite the intuitive logic of these arguments, there is limited empirical evidence supporting them. We address this gap by leveraging unique experimental variation in electoral integrity from a randomized intervention conducted during Colombia’s 2019 mayoral elections, which reduced electoral irregularities. We document four findings. First, treated municipalities experienced increased access to local public goods over the subsequent four years. Second, mayors in treated municipalities became more efficient and less wasteful, as measured by procurement outcomes and corruption-related judicial processes. Third, we develop a novel framework to quantify the contribution of the selection channel and find it plays a substantial role in the overall effect. Finally, we find that alternative explanations—such as increased citizen demand—are unlikely to account for the results. These findings underscore the developmental value of transparent elections.

<summary> <strong style="color:royalblue"> Government Oversight and Inter-Institutional Legibility: Evidence from Colombia </strong> (R&R at the <i>Journal of Politics</i>) <br/>
Natalia Garbiras-Díaz and Tara Slough <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
Effective governance requires reliable information. Many types of administrative data are produced from decentralized entities' reports to the central government. The use of these data for policymaking or oversight creates incentives for decentralized bureaucrats to strategically (mis)report, reducing the quality of the resultant data. We conceptualize this challenge as one of <i>inter-institutional legibility</i>, shaped by principal-agent dynamics between central and decentralized governments. We study these dynamics experimentally in the production of Colombia's National Transparency Index by partnering with a national watchdog agency to assess the effect of increasing the salience of oversight on decentralized entities' reporting behavior. More salient oversight changes reported scores and may marginally increase reporting rates. Comparing self-reports to an independent audit, we show that selection, distortion, and noise in reports limit the legibility of these entities to the central government. Our findings underscore the challenge of administrative data collection and the use of these data.

<summary> <strong style="color:royalblue"> Social Norms and the Persistence of Corruption: Experimental evidence of individuals' attitudes and behavior related to corruption in Latin America </strong> <br/>
Natalia Garbiras-Díaz <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
Despite systematic efforts by both countries and the international community to reduce its prevalence, corruption remains a pervasive phenomenon across the developing world. What explains the persistence of corruption? Furthermore, can social norms account for some of this persistence? In this paper, I study the effect of injunctive norms (the perceived moral rules that determine the approval or disapproval of social behavior) and descriptive norms (the perceived frequency of a conduct in a particular context) on individuals' behavior and attitudes towards corruption. I explore this question using a survey experiment conducted in Argentina, which isolates alternative explanations for corruption. I randomly show respondents vignettes that manipulate either the descriptive or injunctive norm. I then ask them to answer a series of questions that measure their attitudes toward bribery (e.g., the extent to which they consider bribery to be justifiable, among other questions), as well as other behavioral outcomes. While I find empirical evidence for the effect of descriptive norms on both individuals' attitudes and behavior related to corruption; I find no statistical support for the effect of injunctive norms on any of the analyzed outcomes. Taken together, results suggest that descriptive norms operate as informational devices, and that correcting misperceptions about these may serve as an antidote against corruption.  To the best of my knowledge, little work has been done to identify the causal effect of social norms, and their interactions, on corruption. In this respect, this paper makes two contributions. From a theoretical perspective, it contributes to a growing body of research on the  effect of culture on corruption, providing evidence on the causal relationship between social norms and attitudes toward bribery. From a policy perspective, it sheds light on methods to successfully design anti-corruption campaigns that reduce individuals' likelihood to engage in petty corruption.

<summary> <strong strong style="color:royalblue"> Citizens' Commitment to Democracy: Easier Said Than Done? </strong>  <br/>
Natalia Garbiras-Díaz, Loreto Cox and Hernán Carvajal <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
Does citizens' stated commitment to democracy predict their willingness to defend it? We address this question by leveraging a unique setup tracking democratic attitudes surrounding Peru's 2022 self-coup. Our analysis combines an original two-wave pre-coup panel measuring explicit support for democracy through direct questions and implicit support through votes for hypothetical undemocratic candidates in a conjoint experiment with a third wave capturing responses to Pedro Castillo's failed self-coup. We show that condemnation of the coup was not unanimous, and Castillo voters were more forgiving, adjusting their democratic standards and ceasing to view shutting down Congress as undemocratic. Crucially, stated commitment matters: explicit survey responses strongly predict condemnation of the coup, as strongly as having voted for Castillo, while the conjoint measure predicts it only weakly. Robustness analyses using Colombian data provide external validity. Our findings provide methodological and substantive insights into how to anticipate citizens' democratic commitments under stress.

<summary> <strong strong style="color:royalblue"> Corruption and the Rise of Political Outsiders: Evidence from local elections and audits in Brazil </strong>  <br/>
Natalia Garbiras-Díaz <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
How does corruption salience influence the entry of political outsiders? While revelations about corruption are known to influence citizens’ votes, it is unclear whether outsiders take advantage of new opportunities provided by corruption scandals to contest elections. I argue that corruption is a valence issue that allows outsider candidates to draw support from disaffected voters across the ideological spectrum. Using manifestos registered by over forty-nine thousand mayoral candidates in Brazil who ran for election between 2012 and 2020, I construct a novel measure of candidates' use of anti-corruption rhetoric and show that outsider candidates are more likely to resort to this valence appeal. I then exploit revelations of corruption in Brazilian mayoral accounts, using random annual audits conducted by the federal government, to test whether outsider candidates are more likely to take advantage of changes in the salience of corruption. Results indicate that municipalities exposed to such shocks experienced a greater entry of outsider candidates. This paper shows that changes in corruption salience can help overcome barriers to entry for outsider candidates, thereby providing motivation for future research as to the downstream consequences of these shocks, including on democratic backsliding.

<summary> <strong strong style="color:royalblue"> Does compulsory voting breed anti-establishment voting? Evidence from Brazilian presidential elections </strong>  <br/>
Natalia Garbiras-Díaz <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
Public opinion surveys show rising levels of distrust in parties and anti-elite preferences among voters worldwide. By capitalizing on this sentiment, anti-establishment candidates have increasingly won office in new and established democracies alike. Yet, certain institutional arrangements may be more conducive to the electoral success of these candidates. In this paper, I argue that compulsory voting may boost anti-establishment candidates by encouraging turnout among voters who would have otherwise abstained. At the voting booth, these voters are more likely to vote for candidates who align with their anti-establishment sentiment. I test this theory in the context of Brazil’s 2018 presidential election, leveraging age thresholds that make voting compulsory at the individual level as well as randomized variation in the proportion of compulsory voters across voting booths. I demonstrate that compulsory voting led to a sizable increase in electoral support for anti-establishment presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro. My findings underscore how critical turnout is for the prospects of anti-establishment candidates, as well as the unexpected effect of an institution often thought to bolster the quality of democracy.

<summary> <strong strong style="color:royalblue"> The nature, sources, and consequences of citizens’ anti-establishment sentiments: Evidence from two Latin American countries </strong>  <br/>
Loreto Cox and Natalia Garbiras-Díaz <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
While recent studies examine anti-establishment parties and candidates, fewer focus on citizens' anti-establishment sentiments, which we define as an intense and angry animosity toward political elites and distrust of political parties. What are the sources of these sentiments? What are their causal effects on political attitudes and voting behavior? We answer these questions using panel survey data from Colombia and Peru ahead of the 2022 elections. Specifically, we combine priming and conjoint experiments with text analysis of open-ended questions. We find that anti-establishment sentiments are widespread, span the ideological spectrum, and stem mainly from perceptions of corruption and unfulfilled promises. They do not make citizens less democratic but reduce trust in institutions. We also find that candidates who use anti-establishment appeals gain an electoral advantage, which then weakens citizens' punishment of anti-democratic candidates. In Colombia, where voting is voluntary, we also find mobilizing effects of anti-establishment sentiments. Overall, we advance the understanding of citizens' disillusionment with politicians, a pervasive global phenomenon.

<h3>Conflict and Post-conflict Studies</h3> <p>
  
<details>
<summary> <strong style="color:royalblue"> Prospective and retrospective approaches: conflict exposure and attitudes on the peace agreement in Colombia </strong> (<i>Under review</i>) <br/>
Natalia Garbiras-Díaz, Miguel García-Sánchez, and Aila M. Matanock <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
This paper examines how citizens form attitudes toward peace agreements by weighing the costs and benefits of a deal, focusing on Colombia’s 2016 accord with the FARC. While existing research emphasizes evaluations shaped by the costs associated with prior violence, we argue that expectations of future benefits play a critical role in shaping public opinion. Drawing on self-interest theories, we propose that individuals in conflict-affected areas assess peace agreements based on anticipated material and non-material gains. Using a matched-pair design comparing municipalities included in the agreement’s development programs (PDET) with similar non-PDET areas, we evaluate the impact of eligibility for peace-related benefits on citizens’ knowledge, general attitudes, support for provisions, and future expectations. We find that residents in PDET municipalities are more informed, more supportive of provisions for regular citizens, and more optimistic about outcomes. These results suggest that public opinion on peace deals is shaped not only by past costs but also by perceived future benefits, underscoring the importance of forward-looking evaluations in post-conflict settings.

<summary> <strong style="color:royalblue"> Spoiling Support for Peace Processes? </strong> (<i>Under review</i>) <br/>
Aila M. Matanock, Natalia Garbiras-Díaz, and Miguel García-Sánchez <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
This note examines how rebel factions that break from peace agreements can undermine public support for peace agreements. We hypothesize that such spoilers affect: expectations about rebel compliance; attitudes toward reconciliation and reintegration; and confidence in the peace agreement. Using a survey experiment conducted in Colombia shortly after a dissident group rearmed, we test these effects. Results show shifts in public attitudes, especially regarding reconciliation, which may destabilize the peace process. Spoilers can disrupt the path to peace by weakening support for coexistence with former combatants.

<summary> <strong style="color:royalblue"> Do Third Parties Reduce Commitment Problems After Civil War? Microfoundational Evidence from Ex-Combatants in Colombia </strong> (<i>Under review</i>) <br/>
Leopoldo Fergusson, Natalia Garbiras-Díaz, Juana García, Michael Weintraub and Laia Balcells
</summary>
<br/>
Since the Cold War, international third parties such as the United Nations (UN) have become frequent guarantors of peace agreements. Existing studies demonstrate that third parties ameliorate credible commitment problems, in part by reducing acute security threats faced by members of former rebel groups. Yet these studies exclusively marshal evidence at the macro-level, and are therefore unable to show whether ex-combatants are truly reassured by the presence and activities of third parties, and in what ways. Using a novel phone survey of 4,435 ex-combatants from the FARC-EP, Colombia’s largest rebel group, and an embedded survey experiment, we provide the first microfoundational test of prominent third party credible commitment theories. We find no evidence that third actors: increased confidence among ex-combatants that the government would fulfill its commitment to implement the peace agreement; increased confidence that the FARC would do the same; improved perceptions of physical safety; or increased trust in institutions more generally. Put differently, we are unable to recover microfoundational evidence in favor of third party credible commitment theories. We discuss potential explanations for these null findings and the study’s relevance for debates about conflict termination, implementation of the agreements and the duration of peace.

<summary> <strong style="color:royalblue"> Untouchable Forces: Restoring Trust in Security in Weak States? </strong> <br/>
Aila M. Matanock and Natalia Garbiras-Díaz <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
How can weak states improve security? We build on existing work theorizing that a crucial component of strengthening security is improving citizen perceptions of the institutions providing security and then thereby securing their cooperation with those institutions. We examine whether foreign missions that states invite to conduct security functions, "delegation agreements" (DAs), are able to change citizens' perceptions on these dimensions. We argue DAs are likely to improve citizen perceptions of security while they are operating but to have little transfer effect to state institutions. We test the theory by examining the U.N.'s International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), a team of investigators and prosecutors that operated in Guatemalan courts from 2007-2019, which was a canonical and seemingly successful DA. In this "most likely" case to detect any transfer effects, we use a survey experiment to examine, first, whether invoking CICIG as a case investigator increases citizen beliefs that the perpetrators and their state collaborators will be correctly identified, prosecuted, and convicted. We find that the CICIG prime does have consistently positive effects. We then examine citizen perceptions of institutions, and, measuring several outcomes, we find that CICIG has little transfer effect to state security institutions, although a successful CICIG may reduce the legitimacy of the state to some extent. Our results identify a positive effect from this foreign mission but no overall shift in citizen perceptions and subsequent pathway to increased security through their cooperation.

<summary> <strong style="color:royalblue"> Actitudes de exintegrantes de las Farc–EP frente a la reincorporación </strong> <br/>
Ana Arjona, Leopoldo Fergusson, Natalia Garbiras-Díaz, Juana García-Duque, Tatiana Hiller, Lewis Polo and Michael Weintraub <br/>
</summary>
<br/>
En agosto del 2019 se cumplieron dos años de la reincorporación de las Farc-EP. Este proceso es uno de los principales desafíos de la implementación del Acuerdo Final firmado entre el Estado colombiano y la organización guerrillera en noviembre de 2016. Los avances en materia de reincorporación garantizarán su sostenibilidad. En este documento analizamos las actitudes de los exintegrantes frente al proceso en esta primera etapa, tomando los resultados del Registro Nacional de Reincorporación (RNR), realizado entre la Agencia Nacional de Reincorporación (ARN) y el componente Farc del Consejo Nacional de Reincorporación (CNR). Tras mostrar que hay aspectos positivos en las actitudes de las personas en proceso de reincorporación, y algunos que deben mirarse con preocupación, estudiamos qué características de los exintegrantes y su entorno se asocian con mejores actitudes y condiciones para la implementación del proceso de reincorporación. Complementamos este análisis contrastando las actitudes de la población en proceso de reincorporación con las de la población civil, haciendo paralelos, en términos de los retos de política pública, para ambos grupos. La evidencia presentada sirve para canalizar esfuerzos en donde más parecen necesitarse.
