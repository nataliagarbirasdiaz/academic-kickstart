<summary> <span style="color:indigo"> **Using Political Cues for Attitude Formation in Post-Conflict Contexts** ([ESOC Working paper 19](https://esoc.princeton.edu/WP19), under review) </span> <br/>
Natalia Garbiras-Díaz, Miguel García-Sánchez and Aila M. Matanock <br/>
</summary>

Citizens are often asked to evaluate peace agreements seeking to end civil conflicts, by voting on referendums or the negotiating leaders or, even when not voting, deciding whether to cooperate with the implementation of policies like combatant reintegration. In this paper, we assess how citizens form attitudes towards the provisions in peace agreements. These contexts tend to have high polarization, and citizens are asked to weigh in on complex policies, so we theorize that citizens will use cues from political elites with whom they have affinity, and, without these cues, information will have less effect. We assess our theory using survey experiments in Colombia. We find citizens rely on political elites' cues to form their opinion on a peace agreement's provisions, with the direction depending on the citizen's affinity with the political elites. Additional information about these policies has little effect. The paper suggests that even these high stakes decisions can be seen as politics as usual.

<summary> <span style="color:indigo"> **Do citizens' preferences matter? \\Shaping elite attitudes towards peace agreements** (Under review) </span> <br/>
Natalia Garbiras-Díaz, Miguel García-Sánchez and Aila M. Matanock <br/>
</summary>

Citizens are increasingly seen as having a central role in peace processes, engaging in many negotiations and even some approval plebiscites, for example. Citizens are especially important in implementation when a society reconfigures its institutions and rebuilds its state. However, implementing a peace agreement also typically requires piecemeal legislation that can either faithfully adopt its terms or revise and even revert to the status quo. In this paper, we examine the extent to which political elites responsible for this component of implementation are responsive to citizens' preferences. We partnered with the *Misión de Observación Electoral* (MOE), a well-known NGO that specializes on the monitoring of electoral processes in Colombia, to embed an experimental question about the settlement between the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels and the Colombian government in the 2018 wave of a periodic survey on the members of Congress. We inform legislators about the position of different citizens on a policy that emerged from the peace agreement: citizen support for the creation of 16 special seats reserved for conflict areas. We find that legislators underestimate citizen support for this policy, and the magnitude of their misperceptions is correlated with the positions of their parties on the issue. Moreover, we find that providing information about citizens' support for the policy largely does not affect legislator support. These results suggest that legislators form their priors about civilian attitudes through partisan lenses, and that citizen preferences on particular policies may not shape their positions, which are largely based on their party's overarching platform instead.

<summary> <span style="color:indigo"> **Untouchable Forces: Restoring Trust in Security in Weak States?** </span> <br/>
Aila M. Matanock and Natalia Garbiras-Díaz <br/>
</summary>

How can weak states improve security? We build on existing work theorizing that a crucial component of strengthening security is improving citizen perceptions of the institutions providing security and then thereby securing their cooperation with those institutions. We examine whether foreign missions that states invite to conduct security functions, "delegation agreements" (DAs), are able to change citizens' perceptions on these dimensions. We argue DAs are likely to improve citizen perceptions of security while they are operating but to have little transfer effect to state institutions. We test the theory by examining the U.N.'s International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), a team of investigators and prosecutors that operated in Guatemalan courts from 2007-2019, which was a canonical and seemingly successful DA. In this "most likely" case to detect any transfer effects, we use a survey experiment to examine, first, whether invoking CICIG as a case investigator increases citizen beliefs that the perpetrators and their state collaborators will be correctly identified, prosecuted, and convicted. We find that the CICIG prime does have consistently positive effects. We then examine citizen perceptions of institutions, and, measuring several outcomes, we find that CICIG has little transfer effect to state security institutions, although a successful CICIG may reduce the legitimacy of the state to some extent. Our results identify a positive effect from this foreign mission but no overall shift in citizen perceptions and subsequent pathway to increased security through their cooperation.

<summary> <span style="color:indigo"> **The pacifying role of education: The case of Radio Sutatenza** </span> <br/>
Natalia Garbiras-Díaz and Laura García-Montoya <br/>
</summary>

Between 1947 and 1994, Radio Sutatenza influenced the lives of millions of Colombians through its broadcasted lessons and \textit{Escuelas Radiof\'onicas}. In this paper, we explore the effects of Radio Sutatenza and Escuelas Radiof\'onicas on armed conflict intensity. That is both on violence and on the expansion of armed group presence. The findings of this paper advance our understanding of the relationship between education and civil war. The context in which Radio Sutatenza was created and its later phase of expansion offers a unique opportunity to study whether education can break violence cycles. We estimate the effect of \textit{Escuelas Radiof\'onicas} on the incidence of violence at the municipal level using two different identification strategies, a difference in differences design and an instrumental variables approach. We find robust evidence for the pacifying effect of education at the subnational level. Specifically, municipalities with radio schools experienced lower violence levels in the 1960s and, later, in the 1970s.

<summary> <span style="color:indigo"> **Can the Size of the Legislature Decrease Government Efficiency? Evidence from Colombia's Councils** </span> <br/>
Mario Chacón and Natalia Garbiras-Díaz <br/>
</summary>

Can the size of the legislature affect the efficiency and quality of public administration? Recent empirical work on the economic consequences of legislative organization has focused exclusively on the relationship between legislative size and fiscal spending. We expand the scope of this literature by exploring the impact of bigger legislative bodies on the efficiency of public service provision. We use a constitutional rule which creates a discontinuous relationship between population and size of elected councils in Colombia to estimate the effect of legislature size on the efficiency of local public goods. Theoretically a bigger councils should increase the checks and accountability on the local executive, and thus leading to higher and better quality public goods provision. Yet we find no systematic evidence for such positive mechanism. Moreover, we find preliminary negative and signifficant effects on fiscal and administrative efficiency, particularly in small cities. Our results indicate a more nuanced relationship between legislative size and government efficiency, and complement the theoretical literature on public overspending.

Natalia Garbiras-Díaz <br/>
</summary>

Despite systematic efforts by both countries and the international community to reduce its prevalence, corruption remains a pervasive phenomenon across the developing world. What explains the persistence of corruption? Furthermore, can social norms account for some of this persistence? In this paper, I study the effect of injunctive norms (the perceived moral rules that determine the approval or disapproval of social behavior) and descriptive norms (the perceived frequency of a conduct in a particular context) on individuals' behavior and attitudes towards corruption. I explore this question using a survey experiment conducted in Argentina, which isolates alternative explanations for corruption. I randomly show respondents vignettes that manipulate either the descriptive or injunctive norm. I then ask them to answer a series of questions that measure their attitudes toward bribery (e.g., the extent to which they consider bribery to be justifiable, among other questions), as well as other behavioral outcomes. While I find empirical evidence for the effect of descriptive norms on both individuals' attitudes and behavior related to corruption; I find no statistical support for the effect of injunctive norms on any of the analyzed outcomes. Taken together, results suggest that descriptive norms operate as informational devices, and that correcting misperceptions about these may serve as an antidote against corruption.  To the best of my knowledge, little work has been done to identify the causal effect of social norms, and their interactions, on corruption. In this respect, this paper makes two contributions. From a theoretical perspective, it contributes to a growing body of research on the  effect of culture on corruption, providing evidence on the causal relationship between social norms and attitudes toward bribery. From a policy perspective, it sheds light on methods to successfully design anti-corruption campaigns that reduce individuals' likelihood to engage in petty corruption.
