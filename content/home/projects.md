**Title:** *Paving the way for the rise of outsiders: candidate and voter behavior in the era of political disillusionment* <br/>
**Committee:** Thad Dunning (Chair), Aila Matanock, Ruth Collier & Ernesto Dal Bó <br/>

My dissertation studies the causes and consequences of anti-establishment political candidates. Across many young and advanced democracies alike, citizens are disillusioned with political and party systems. In this context, I argue that anti-establishment and anti-corruption appeals provide promising campaign devices for political challengers seeking to mobilize those disenchanted voters. Yet, the effectiveness of these appeals varies across informational and institutional environments, as I explore in different parts of my dissertation.

<summary> <strong style="color:royalblue"> Does compulsory voting breed anti-establishment voting? Evidence from Brazilian presidential elections </strong> </summary>
<br/>  
Public opinion surveys show rising levels of distrust in parties and anti-elite preferences among voters worldwide. By capitalizing on this sentiment, anti-establishment candidates have increasingly won office in new and established democracies alike. Yet, certain institutional arrangements may be more conducive to the electoral success of these candidates. In this paper, I argue that compulsory voting may boost anti-establishment candidates by encouraging turnout among voters who would have otherwise abstained. At the voting booth, these voters are more likely to vote for candidates who align with their anti-establishment sentiment. I test this theory in the context of Brazil’s 2018 presidential election, leveraging age thresholds that make voting compulsory at the individual level as well as randomized variation in the proportion of compulsory voters across voting booths. I demonstrate that compulsory voting led to a sizable increase in electoral support for anti-establishment presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro. My findings underscore how critical turnout is for the prospects of anti-establishment candidates, as well as the unexpected effect of an institution often thought to bolster the quality of democracy.

<summary> <strong style="color:royalblue"> Monitoring the Vote or Voting to Monitor? Evidence from Two Large Scale Field Experiments in Colombia </strong> </summary>
With Mateo Montenegro
<br/>  
Can crowdsourcing technologies aimed at augmenting civil oversight of elections increase electoral integrity? We report the results of two large-scale field experiments designed to assess the effectiveness of online crowdsourcing technologies in increasing the engagement of civil society in electoral monitoring around elections in Colombia. We leveraged Facebook advertisements to encourage citizen reporting of electoral irregularities through official websites, and also varied whether candidates were informed about the campaign in a subset of municipalities. In addition to the expected informational effects – whereby citizen reports increased, and politicians reduced their engagement in electoral irregularities – the results highlight powerful salience effects, which operated by making electoral irregularities more top-of-mind to citizens. Specifically, the advertisements generated a large shift in the vote share of candidates perceived to be less corrupt and away from those perceived to be more corrupt. We argue that these salience effects are driven by a shift in voter preferences towards candidates they perceived as ‘cleaner’. We formally test this hypothesis in a follow-up experiment around the 2019 mayoral elections in which we vary the salience of electoral irregularities in the advertisements sent through Facebook. As expected, we find that the advertisements featuring messages emphasizing the salience of electoral misdeeds generate a larger shift in the votes for ‘cleaner’ candidates than the ones only providing information about the reporting website.
